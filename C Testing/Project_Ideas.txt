Diary management System
In this project, the user will simulate operation on a personal diary such as creation or diary, 
writing a page, reading a page, searching a phrase on a given date, etc. Here, you can use simple 
text fields to save diary information. You can also build a security feature (password or 
paraphrase) on top of it. This project will help you practice functions, pointers, and searching/sorting
algorithms.

Library Management System
Library management is a project that manages and preserves electronic book data based on the demands of 
students. Both students and library administrators can use the system to keep track of all the books available 
in the library. It allows both the administrator and the student to look for the desired book. The C files 
used to implement the system are: main.c, searchbook.c, issuebook.c, viewbook.c, and more.
